# Contributing to `awsum-lang.org`

Thanks for your interest in contributing.

## Development setup

Plain HTML/CSS — no build step. Edit files under `static/` and open them directly in a browser to preview. See [README.md](README.md) and [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for site layout and conventions.

## Signed commits

The `main` branch requires signed commits — every commit you push to a PR needs a verified signature, otherwise the merge button stays grey.

Minimal `~/.gitconfig` for SSH signing:

```ini
[user]
	email = ...
	name = ...
	signingkey = ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
[commit]
	gpgsign = true
[gpg]
	format = ssh
```

For GPG signing instead, set `gpg.format = openpgp` (or omit — that's the default) and point `signingkey` at your GPG key ID. The option name `gpgsign` is git's historical name for "sign this thing" and applies regardless of format.

The same key file must be added to GitHub Settings → SSH and GPG keys as a **Signing Key** (a separate category from Authentication Key, even if you reuse the same file). Verify locally:

```bash
git commit -S -m "test" --allow-empty
git log --show-signature -1
```

If you already made unsigned commits on a feature branch, retroactively sign with:

```bash
git rebase --exec 'git commit --amend --no-edit -S' <range>
```

then force-push your branch.

## Pull requests

Open against `main`. The site auto-deploys to GitHub Pages on merge.
